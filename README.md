# GeofenceLocationDemo

Location detection to power their location-based experiences and engagement. However, native geofencing technology can only deliver accuracy of around 100-200 meters.

We have done short demo with the help of corelocation framework.
The most common forms of geofencing marketing are app notifications and ads.

To find out Entry and Exit for specific device location radius, we use geofencing.

## GeofenceLocationDemo

Location detection to power their location-based experiences and engagement. However, native geofencing technology can only deliver accuracy of around 100-200 meters.

You can setup your own geofence by providing latitude and longitude, and it will notify your app when the device enters or leaves the geofence.

Implementation of geofencing can be useful in various cases, You can define geofence that can trigger a notification whenever user enters or leaves the restaurant, Shopping center or particular region. 

In this geofencing tutorial, you will learn how to use region monitoring in iOS with Swift 4.0 â€“ using the Region Monitoring API in Core Location.

# Requirements
Minimum OS 10.0 and later

# MVVM Design pattern
I have created a singleton Class for Geofence Location Engine to work independently. 
* Required:- We need location access for this Demo.

# Installation
=======
# Tip
- To test in simulator you can use .GPX file (add GPX file file-> new -> under resource section there will option of GPX file)
- For using GPX file when app is running in simulator there is option in xCode (debug -> simulate location -> select your GPX file)

# Manual Installation
- First thing we need to do is setup Location manager and Location permissions.
            
>>>>>>> 703849c9afda424a1a0496f7de63e2ebea959cb2
- Run the application on XCODE 12.3,

- You have to run the application on simulator only


# How to use app

1. Click on 'UPDATE' navigation button and enter the location name and latitude, longitude.

2. On Simulator navigation bar -> Go to Featuure -> Location -> Custom Location

*For Simulate Device Location

3.  Enter the custom Latitude & Longitude of location of selected City -> Click On 'Ok' Button

4. If the device simulated location is in given geofencing area, then label text will update as Enter In: XYZ city or Exit in: XYZ area
