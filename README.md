# GeofenceLocationDemo

Location detection to power their location-based experiences and engagement. However, native geofencing technology can only deliver accuracy of around 100-200 meters.

We have done short demo with the help of corelocation framework.
The most common forms of geofencing marketing are app notifications and ads.

To find out Entry and Exit for specific device location radius, we use geofencing.

# MVVM Design pattern
I have created a singleton Class for Geofence Location Engine to work independently. 
* Required:- We need location access for this Demo.


# Installation
- Run the application on XCODE 12.3,

- You have to run the application on simulator only


# How to use app

1. Click on 'UPDATE' navigation button and enter the location name and latitude, longitude.

2. On Simulator navigation bar -> Go to Featuure -> Location -> Custom Location

*For Simulate Device Location

3.  Enter the custom Latitude & Longitude of location of selected City -> Click On 'Ok' Button

4. If the device simulated location is in given geofencing area, then label text will update as Enter In: XYZ city or Exit in: XYZ area
